- support stopping a pcf with multiple deployments, not just cf

one idea:
 make the bosh vms reader smarter
  don't just filter on -partition-
  instead be deployment aware
  group the list into a map keyed by deployment name

  i.e. list of vms by deployment:
  parse step:
  look for ^Deployment '$deployment_name'$
  then subsequent vms belong to that deployment
  so you accumulate a list deployments, and sort them so that cf-* is last


  first delete all vms (in any order) for deployments that are not cf!
  then sort the cf vms by stop order and stop them

- support starting
- how to make this run on opsmanager/jumpbox where i have no gradle? -- use gradlew perhaps
