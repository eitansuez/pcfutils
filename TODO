A. make stop then start work in an automated way
1. save list of vms when stop pcf
2. retrofit start task to read the list of vms from that saved file
3. retest the whole thing

B. think through and handle failure scenarios

C. replace "test mode" with exec vs "produce script" mode.

ok, got it.  get rid fo exec mode altogether.  get rid of two tasks.  have just one.  all it will do is produce a stop script and a start script that the end user can then invoke at their leisure.

move the test resources back to test/resources

add a bosh cloudcheck into start script after each deployment

when stopping non-elasatic runtime deployments, there may exist a consideration where the broker needs to be stopped before other vms in that deployment.  investigate.  perhaps using p-mysql.  check out their docs.
